# Rector - Upgrade Your Legacy App to a Modern Codebase

Rector is a **rec**onstruc**tor** tool - it does **instant upgrades** and **instant refactoring** of your code.
Why refactor manually if Rector can handle 80% for you?

...**look at the overview of [all available Rectors](/docs/AllRectorsOverview.md)** with before/after diffs and configuration examples. You can use them to build your own sets.

## How to Apply Coding Standards?

The AST libraries that Rector uses aren't well-suited for coding standards, so it's better to let coding standard tools do that.

Don't have a coding standard tool for your project? Consider adding [EasyCodingStandard](https://github.com/Symplify/EasyCodingStandard), [PHP CS Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer) or [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer).

Tip: If you have EasyCodingStandard, you can start your set with [`ecs-after-rector.yaml`](/ecs-after-rector.yaml).

## Install

```bash
composer require rector/rector --dev
```

**Do you have conflicts during `composer require` or on run?**

- Use the [Rector Prefixed](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector-prefixed)

**Do you need different PHP version than Rector supports?**

- Use the [Docker image](#run-rector-in-docker)

## Running Rector

### A. Get Started

Try the demo and get familiar with rector

- [Rector demo](https://github.com/rectorphp/demo)
- [Rector training](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector-training)

### B. Prepared Sets

Featured open-source projects have **prepared sets**. You can find them in [`/config/set`](/config/set) or by running:

```bash
vendor/bin/rector sets
```

Let's say you pick the [`symfony40`](/config/set/symfony) set and you want to upgrade your `/src` directory:

```bash
# show a list of known changes in Symfony 4.0
vendor/bin/rector process src --set symfony40 --dry-run
```

```bash
# apply upgrades to your code
vendor/bin/rector process src --set symfony40
```

Some sets, such as [`code-quality`](/config/set/code-quality) can be
used on a regular basis. You can include them in your `rector.yaml` to
run them by default:

```yaml
# rector.yaml
parameters:
    sets:
        - 'code-quality'
        - 'php71'
        - 'php72'
        - 'php73'
```

### C. Custom Sets

1. Create a `rector.yaml` config file with your desired Rectors:

    ```yaml
    services:
        Rector\Rector\Architecture\DependencyInjection\AnnotatedPropertyInjectToConstructorInjectionRector:
            $annotation: "inject"
    ```

2. Run Rector on your `/src` directory:

    ```bash
    vendor/bin/rector process src --dry-run
    # apply
    vendor/bin/rector process src
    ```


## Features

### Extra Autoloading

Rector relies on project and autoloading of its classes. To specify your own autoload file, use `--autoload-file` option:

```bash
vendor/bin/rector process ../project --autoload-file ../project/vendor/autoload.php
```

Or use a `rector.yaml` config file:

```yaml
# rector.yaml
parameters:
    autoload_paths:
        - 'vendor/squizlabs/php_codesniffer/autoload.php'
        - 'vendor/project-without-composer'
```

### Exclude Paths and Rectors

You can also **exclude files or directories** (with regex or [fnmatch](http://php.net/manual/en/function.fnmatch.php)):

```yaml
# rector.yaml
parameters:
    exclude_paths:
        - '*/src/*/Tests/*'
```

You can use a whole ruleset, except one rule:

```yaml
# rector.yaml
parameters:
    exclude_rectors:
        - 'Rector\CodeQuality\Rector\If_\SimplifyIfReturnBoolRector'
```

Do you want to skip just specific line with specific rule?

Use `@noRector \FQN name` annotation:

```php
class SomeClass
{
    /**
     * @noRector \Rector\DeadCode\Rector\ClassMethod\RemoveEmptyClassMethodRector
     */
    public function foo()
    {
        /** @noRector \Rector\DeadCode\Rector\Plus\RemoveDeadZeroAndOneOperationRector */
        round(1 + 0);
    }
}
```

### Filter Rectors

If you have a configuration file for Rector including many sets and Rectors, you might want at times to run only a single Rector from them. The `--only` argument allows that, for example :

```bash
vendor/bin/rector process --set solid --only "Rector\SOLID\Rector\Class_\FinalizeClassesWithoutChildrenRector" src/
```

Will only run `Rector\SOLID\Rector\Class_\FinalizeClassesWithoutChildrenRector`.

Please note that the backslash in the Rector's fully-qualified class name needs to be properly escaped (by surrounding the string in double quotes).

### Provide PHP Version

By default Rector uses the language features matching your system version of PHP. You can configure it for a different PHP version:

```yaml
# rector.yaml
parameters:
    php_version_features: '7.2' # your version is 7.3
```

### Paths

If you're annoyed by repeating paths in arguments, you can move them to config instead:

```yaml
# rector.yaml
parameters:
    paths:
        - 'src'
        - 'tests'
```

### Import Use Statements

FQN classes are not imported by default. If you don't to do do it manually after every Rector run, enable it by:

```yaml
# rector.yaml
parameters:
    auto_import_names: true
```

You can also fine-tune how these imports are processed:

```yaml
# rector.yaml
parameters:
    # this will not import root namespace classes, like \DateTime or \Exception
    import_short_classes: false

    # this will not import classes used in PHP DocBlocks, like in /** @var \Some\Class */
    import_doc_blocks: false
```

### Limit Execution to Changed Files

Execution can be limited to changed files using the `process` option `--match-git-diff`.
This option will filter the files included by the configuration, creating an intersection with the files listed in `git diff`.

```bash
vendor/bin/rector process src --match-git-diff
```

This option is useful in CI with pull-requests that only change few files.

### Symfony Container

To work with some Symfony rules, you now need to link your container XML file

```yaml
# rector.yaml
parameters:
    # path to load services from
    symfony_container_xml_path: 'var/cache/dev/AppKernelDevDebugContainer.xml'
```

## 3 Steps to Create Your Own Rector

First, make sure it's not covered by [any existing Rectors](/docs/AllRectorsOverview.md).

Let's say we want to **change method calls from `set*` to `change*`**.

```diff
 $user = new User();
-$user->setPassword('123456');
+$user->changePassword('123456');
```

### 1. Create a New Rector and Implement Methods

Create a class that extends [`Rector\Rector\AbstractRector`](/src/Rector/AbstractRector.php). It will inherit useful methods e.g. to check node type and name. See the source (or type `$this->` in an IDE) for a list of available methods.

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Rector;

use Nette\Utils\Strings;
use PhpParser\Node;
use PhpParser\Node\Identifier;
use PhpParser\Node\Expr\MethodCall;
use Rector\Rector\AbstractRector;
use Rector\RectorDefinition\CodeSample;
use Rector\RectorDefinition\RectorDefinition;

final class MyFirstRector extends AbstractRector
{
    public function getDefinition(): RectorDefinition
    {
        // what does this do?
        // minimalistic before/after sample - to explain in code
        return new RectorDefinition('Change method calls from set* to change*.', [
            new CodeSample('$user->setPassword("123456");', '$user->changePassword("123456");')
        ]);
    }

    /**
     * @return string[]
     */
    public function getNodeTypes(): array
    {
        // what node types we look for?
        // pick any node from https://github.com/rectorphp/rector/blob/master/docs/NodesOverview.md
        return [MethodCall::class];
    }

    /**
     * @param MethodCall $node - we can add "MethodCall" type here, because only this node is in "getNodeTypes()"
     */
    public function refactor(Node $node): ?Node
    {
        // we only care about "set*" method names
        if (! $this->isName($node->name, 'set*')) {
            // return null to skip it
            return null;
        }

        $methodCallName = $this->getName($node);
        $newMethodCallName = Strings::replace($methodCallName, '#^set#', 'change');

        $node->name = new Identifier($newMethodCallName);

        // return $node if you modified it
        return $node;
    }
}
```

### 2. Register It

```yaml
# rector.yaml
services:
    App\Rector\MyFirstRector: ~
```

### 3. Let Rector Refactor Your Code

```bash
# see the diff first
vendor/bin/rector process src --dry-run

# if it's ok, apply
vendor/bin/rector process src
```

That's it!

## How to Contribute

Just follow 3 rules:

- **1 feature per pull-request**
- **New features need tests**
- Tests, coding standards and PHPStan **checks must pass**:

    ```bash
    composer complete-check
    ```

    Do you need to fix coding standards? Run:

    ```bash
    composer fix-cs
    ```

We would be happy to accept PRs that follow these guidelines.

## Run Rector in Docker
You can run Rector on your project using Docker:

```bash
docker run -v $(pwd):/project rector/rector:latest process /project/src --set symfony40 --dry-run

# Note that a volume is mounted from `pwd` (the current directory) into `/project` which can be accessed later.
```

Using `rector.yaml`:

```bash
docker run -v $(pwd):/project rector/rector:latest process /project/app --config /project/rector.yaml --autoload-file /project/vendor/autoload.php --dry-run
```
